To enable the AMD APP SDK tests:

1) run 'make AMD-APP-SDK-v2.8-RC-lnx64.tgz' to download the SDK

http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/download-archive/

2) configure pocl, it should now detect the AMD benchmark and
   enable it. You need libSDL installed to get it enabled and cmake
   to get it built.

3) call 'make prepare-examples' once to get the examples built

4) call 'make check TESTSUITEFLAGS="-k amdsdk"', it should build 
   the AMD cases and run the pocl test suite for the AMD SDK.

After this you can run tools/scripts/benchmark.py to produce
performance numbers.
